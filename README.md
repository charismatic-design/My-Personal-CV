   - Displays a profile picture, name, education history, skills, and links to other pages.
   - Profile image is loaded from GitHub (online source).
   - Contains links to "Hobbies" and "Contact" pages.

2. hobbies.html
   - A simple page listing Nebiyu's hobbies using an ordered list.

3. contacts.html
   - Contains personal contact information.
   - Includes a basic contact form that uses the `mailto:` action to send emails.
   - Note: The form may not work on all browsers unless an email client is set up.

---------------
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Use the links at the bottom to navigate to the Hobbies or Contact page.

üñºÔ∏è Images:

- Good early practice in structuring a multi-page HTML site!
